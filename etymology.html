        <p>The word "Ugly" is from Old Norse mid- 13 century,  uggligr "dreadful, fearful", from uggr (fear, apprehension, dread) + -ligr (like). 
          Old Norse is a North Germanic language that was spoken in Scandinavia and Denmark from approximately the 9th to 13th centuries. 
          In the late 14 century, the meaning softened to "very unpleasant to look at", "ill-shaped", and "hate, sorrow".
          Looking at the etymology, even the pronunciation of the word uggligr gives off a sense of worthlessness, as if it's not even a proper word. 

          <br><br/>Originally, this word was not associated with visuality but rather focused more on the emotion of fear, which is quite interesting, and the fear of ugliness persists even today. 
          For example, grotesque creatures in horror films provoke a disgusted reaction through their appearance. 
          Similarly, AI-generated robot humans evoke the uncanny valley effect-a negative emotional response triggered by human-like figures that seem almost, but not quite, human.
