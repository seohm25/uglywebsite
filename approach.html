        <p> Ugly-Chic Fashion is a fashion trend meaning it's ugly, but incredibly chic. Today, the public are eager to follow the "ugliness",
           admiring unpredictable, ridiculous, and subversive styles. Even high-fashion brands have used this subversive approach to ugliness to make a groundbreaking impact. 
           Recently, Prada held an Ugly Chic show to reject conventional beauty standards and celebrate imperfection. 
           Prada explored beauty in the unexpected and unconventional, blurring aesthetic boundaries and paving the way for new fashion trends.  

          <br><br/>So why is ugliness considered subversive? Ugliness is seen as a subversion because it breaks the absolute standards we implicitly accept and challenges them. 
          This also encourages people to keep thinking from different perspectives, stepping outside of conventional notions. 
          In our society, there are implicit standards for what is considered ugly and beautiful, so before recognizing ugly chic style as one type of new fashion, 
          people focus on the fact that ugly fashion has "changed" the previous trends, prompting them to consider other perspectives. 
          This can be also related to the fear of ugliness-this fear gives a sense of "a shift in perspective" to those viewing ugly-chic and leads them to see it as a subversion.
