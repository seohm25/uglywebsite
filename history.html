        <p>The figurines of Venus of Willendorf (28,000-25000 BCE) symbolize "feminine beauty" at that period. 
          Some argue that in the Paleolithic era, survival and health were prioritized, abundance and fertility the primary standards of beauty. 
          Conversely, a thin and skinny appearance could be interpreted as a form of "ugliness" by the standards of that time. 
          However, today, our criteria for beauty and ugliness are almost the opposite of those from that era. 
          People often judge themselves based on these fixed and absolute standards, which can lead to discrimination.
          It shows that the criteria of ugliness and beauty shift over with each era.

          <br><br/>As time has passed, many people have increasingly embraced body positivity and sought to break free from the pressures of rigid beauty standards. 
          While those standards are still prevalent, more individuals are striving to view themselves and others as they are. 
          The growing acceptance of diverse body types in fashion models, mannequins, and other representations challenges societal norms and emphasizes the value of diversity. 
          Thus, the definition of ugliness continues to change with time. Will future generations agree with the way we define "ugliness" today?
