        <p>The Ugly Duckling represents the ugliness as a hostility towards difference. 
          A ugly baby duck is born looking different from the other ducklings and, as a result, faces rejection from his siblings and even his own mother.
          Simply because of his different appearance, all ducks surrounding him ignore and bully him. In the end, the story concludes with the baby duck realizing that he was different because he was actually a swan, and he finally finds his place among other swans.
          What I find interesting here is that the standard of 'ugly' seems to be defined by 'difference'. 
          In reality, the baby swan was not ugly but simply looked different from the ducklings. 
          Many creatures appear to have an instinct that drives them to react negatively and aggressively towards those who are different. 
          In this sense, I wonder if 'ugly' is less about external shape or appearance and more about a primal instinct of hostility towards difference. 
          The reason people become hostile towards those who are different is due to the fear of the unknown and unpredictability. In other words, the fear of ignorance drives them to use hostility as a defense mechanism to prepare for situations we cannot anticipate. 
          This hostility can, in turn, lead to prejudice and discrimination.
